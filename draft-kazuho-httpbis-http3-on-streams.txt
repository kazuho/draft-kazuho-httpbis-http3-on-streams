1.  Introduction

   As of 2023, HTTP/2 [HTTP2] remains the most widely used version of
   HTTP across the Internet, although the adoption rate of HTTP/3
   [HTTP3] is increasing rapidly.

   HTTP/3 has several advantages over HTTP/2, primarily due to its use
   of QUIC [QUIC] as the transport layer protocol, which provides
   features like stream multiplexing without head-of-line blocking and
   low-latency connection establishment.

   However, given that QUIC's availability and accessibility are not as
   universal as TCP's, a complete migration of all HTTP/2 traffic to
   QUIC-based HTTP/3 seems unlikely.

   This situation necessitates HTTP deployments to support both
   transport protocols and their respective HTTP versions for the
   foreseeable future.

   Maintaining dual support is costly, as the two protocols differ in
   many aspects such as wire-encoding, flow control and stream
   multiplexing machinery, and HTTP header compression.  Extensions
   operating at the HTTP wire encoding layer must be developed and
   implemented for both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and both protocol stacks
   require ongoing maintenance to address bugs, performance issues, and
   vulnerabilities.

   To address this redundancy, this specification defines the method of
   running HTTP/3 over TCP, utilizing QUIC on Streams [QUIC-ON-STREAMS]
   as the basis.  QUIC on Streams, acting as a polyfill of QUIC atop bi-
   directional byte streams, enables the operation of HTTP/3 over TCP
   without any modifications.

   Consequently, design, implementation, and maintenance efforts can
   concentrate on a single HTTP version: HTTP/3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Protocol

   HTTP/3 functions over QUIC version 1, employing the set of operations
   (i.e., API) defined in Section 2.4 and Section 5.3 of [QUIC].
   Conversely, HTTP/3 on Streams utilizes the same set of operations but
   functions over QUIC on Streams instead.

4.  Starting HTTP/3 on Streams

   HTTP/3 on Streams can be used for “http” and “https” URI schemes
   defined in Section 4.2 of [HTTP-SEMANTICS] with the same default port
   numbers as HTTP/1.1 [HTTP1].

   When starting HTTP/3 on Streams for “https” URIs, clients use the TLS
   [TLS13] with the ALPN [ALPN] extension: “h3s”.

   Also, clients may learn that a particular server supports HTTP/3 on
   Streams by other means.  A client that knows that a server supports
   HTTP/3 on Streams can establish a TCP connection and start exchanging
   HTTP/3 frames using QUIC on Streams.

   The latter is the only way to discover HTTP/3 on Streams for “http”
   URIs.

   When used in cleartext, servers can determine if or not the client is
   speaking HTTP/3 on Streams by comparing the first eight bytes to the
   encoded form of the QS_TRANSPORT_PARAMETERS frame type (Section 4.2
   of [QUIC-ON-STREAMS]).

5.  Support for Extended CONNECT

   Servers speaking HTTP/3 on Streams MUST implement the Extended
   CONNECT scheme defined in [EXT-CONNECT3].
